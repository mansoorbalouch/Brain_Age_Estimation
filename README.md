# Brain_Age_Estimation

Brain age estimation, a data-driven biomarker for different neurological disorders, employs machine learning techniques on the structural and functional brain MRIs of healthy controls (HC). A detailed neuroimaging pipeline is followed for pre-processing the MRIs and feature extraction using tools such as FreeSurfer, FSL, SPM12, and CAT12. Similarly,the data science approaches such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, statistical tests, and data visualization are also widely being applied for developing efficient brain age estimation frameworks.
