# Brain_Age_Estimation

Brain age estimation refers to the prediction of the biological brain age (apparently how old a person's brain looks like) using the MRIs. Brain estimated age difference, Brain-EAD, is the difference between a person's biological brain age and the chronological age. Brain-EAD is a data-driven biomarker for different neurological disorders and employs machine learning techniques on the structural and functional brain MRIs of healthy controls (HC) for developing such a framework. A detailed neuroimaging pipeline is followed for pre-processing the MRIs and, subsequently, features extraction using tools such as FreeSurfer, FSL, SPM12, and CAT12. Similarly, the data science approaches such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, statistical tests, and data visualization are widely applied for developing efficient brain age estimation frameworks.  
A series of steps are executed for this purpose:
# T1-weighted MRI Preprocessing 

# Feature Extraction

# Feature Engineering and Feature Selection

# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Model training

# Performance Evaluation and Results Visualization
